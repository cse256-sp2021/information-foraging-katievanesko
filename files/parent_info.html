        <h1>Parent Information</h1>
        <h2>Parent School Partnership</h2>
        <p>
          When joined by a common set of beliefs and purposes, a school and its
          parents form a powerful team with far-reaching positive effects on
          children and the entire school community. As a result, WUNS relies on
          its parents to understand and embrace the School’s philosophy and
          values, and fully support its curriculum, teachers/staff, and
          administration. Working together, parents and school professionals
          exert a strong influence on children’s development and help them to
          mature by modeling healthy adult working relationships based on
          honesty, trust, civility, and mutual respect. The teachers, staff, and
          administration of WUNS share our parents’ commitment to their children
          and join them in partnership dedicated to the growth of each child.
          This partnership begins with timely, honest and open communication
          between home and school, and is premised on an assumption of goodwill
          and a shared interest in what is best for each individual child.
          Parents can best support this climate of trust and respect by
          communicating concerns openly and constructively to the teacher. If a
          satisfactory conclusion is not reached, the parent should then contact
          the Director. Out of respect for the individual needs and privacy of
          each family, the Nursery School places a high value on confidentiality
          and expects individual families to honor the same. Efforts to lobby
          other parents are contrary to the spirit of the Parent School
          Partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
          By enrolling their child(ren) in WUNS, parents agree to support the
          School’s vision, follow its rules and policies, and abide by its
          decisions. Just as parents can expect the Nursery School to share
          timely information and concerns with families concerning their child,
          so too the Nursery School expects parents to approach issues and
          concerns in a spirit of mutual goodwill, using proper channels, and in
          a manner that gives everyone the benefit of the doubt and leads to
          collaborative and constructive solutions. While parents may not agree
          with every decision, in most cases, the parents and Nursery School
          will find enough common ground to continue a mutually respectful and
          productive relationship. However, when it is clear that a
          constructive, positive relationship cannot be maintained, the School
          reserves the right to deny continued attendance or re-enrollment.
