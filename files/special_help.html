        <h1>Personalized Help & Special Needs</h1>
        <h2>Personalized Help</h2>
        <p>
          The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and
          assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently
          plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to meet students’
          needs. If one or more children need help in a specific area, the
          curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:
        </p>
        <div class="bullet">
          <p>
            • Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the
            child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student
            confidence
          </p>
          <p>• Offering more opportunities for exploration</p>
          <p>• Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</p>
          <p>• Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</p>
          <p>
            • Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than
            previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in
            the learning process
          </p>
          <p>
            • Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities
            around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Referral Process for Children with Special Needs</h2>
        <p>
          It is the policy at the nursery school that after school is underway
          and teachers have had time to observe children in the classroom, a
          teacher who feels help is needed in understanding the behavior of a
          child in the classroom will ask the director to come and observe.
          After reviewing our observations, we schedule an appointment with the
          parents to discuss the school behavior. In the course of that meeting,
          we may request that a community professional evaluate the child in the
          classroom. This observation may result in a request for further
          evaluation. If needed, community facilities that better serve the
          child’s needs may be recommended to the parents.
