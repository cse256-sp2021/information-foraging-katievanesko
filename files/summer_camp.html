        <p>
          Designed for children ages two and a half to five years, our summer
          camp program includes a wide range of creative indoor and outdoor
          activities, with time to explore and discover, play and make friends.
          Since a good number of hours are spent outside during summer camp, the
          nursery school playground provides opportunities to cool off with
          outdoor water play that includes troughs, sprinklers and hoses.
          Building in the sand and playing on the climbing equipment are two
          other favorite outdoor activities. An adjoining wading pool is
          available for summer campers, whether enrolled in the swimming classes
          or not. Children bring their own lunches. Camp provides a morning
          snack.
        </p>
        <p>
          3-Bears Camp is located in the Washington University Nursery School
          facility on the Washington University campus. It is composed of three
          classrooms and an all-purpose room, which are designed to offer
          children a variety of choices in their play. Our large outdoor play
          area gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide,
          and play in the sand and water.
        </p>
        <h4>Swimming Lessons</h4>
        <p>
          Children may take advantage of swimming lessons offered as an optional
          program during each session. There will be eight lessons per session,
          at an additional cost on top of regular summer camp tuition. Children
          must be toilet trained to participate in swimming lessons. The
          swimming pool is located adjacent to the Nursery School.
        </p>
        <h4>Bear Tracks Extended Day Program</h4>
        <p>
          Additional afternoon play with mixed-age children. Children must be
          toilet trained to attend Bear Tracks.
