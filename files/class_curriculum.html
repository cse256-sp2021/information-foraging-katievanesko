          <h2>Curriculum Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children
            are unique individuals with their own patterns and timetables for
            social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development. We
            support and encourage their development through our child-centered,
            process-oriented, play- based curriculum built on Constructivist
            theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of educational
            theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we
            create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs
            of the whole child by:
          </p>
          <div class="bullet">
            <p>
              • Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that
              are relevant to the students, with the understanding that
              knowledge is constructed through language, discussion,
              experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful
              to them
            </p>
            <p>
              • Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of
              materials, engage multiple senses, and encourage exploration,
              investigation, and learning
            </p>
            <p>
              • Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her
              own pace, and creating opportunities for children to explore
              individually, with a partner, or with a larger group of peers
            </p>
            <p>
              • Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to
              thoughtfully form responses, listening respectfully to their
              replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they seek as
              they develop enhanced reasoning skills
            </p>
            <p>
              • Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking,
              and empowering students to become problem solvers
            </p>
            <p>
              • Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural
              population to highlight the similarities and differences between
              individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the unique
              environment that is Washington University Nursery School.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is
            presented in ways that are developmentally appropriate and based on
            our philosophy that children learn most effectively through play.
            Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers
            experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks,
            manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into account the
            social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of
            each child.
