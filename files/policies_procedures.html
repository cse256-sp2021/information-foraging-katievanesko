          <h2>Orientation Day</h2>
          <p>
            This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the
            child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the
            teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time
            for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief
            overview of what to expect during the school year. <br/> <br/>
            The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either
            Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided
            in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule
            allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before
            the entire class attends on Friday.

          <h2>Daily Procedures</h2>

          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>
            Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These
            three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school
            day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3
            parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit
            should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located
            off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is
            $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide
            validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special
            school events.
          </p>

          <h3>Clothing</h3>
          <p>
            It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are
            comfortable, washable, and suitable for activities both indoors and
            outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of clothing
            appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should
            be aware of weather conditions and dress children accordingly, as
            outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. During the
            winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will
            usually go outside when it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill
            taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent
            marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified.
          </p>

          <h3>Snacks</h3>
          <p>
            The nursery school provides a healthy snack each day for the
            children. Fresh fruit (apples, oranges, pears, bananas, melons,
            etc.) are purchased each week and kept in the “children’s
            refrigerator.” There are a wide variety of crackers (soda, graham,
            Ritz, Goldfish, etc.) available. Snack time consists of a fruit,
            crackers and water. The older children learn to pour their own
            water.
          </p>

          <h3>Drop-Off and Pick-Up</h3>
          <p>
            All traffic for arrival and dismissal must proceed from the parking
            lot entrance west of the school, driving east and stopping at the
            school entrance. Drivers stay in their cars and teachers help the
            children enter and exit. Teachers are outside for arrival of
            children at 8:50 a.m. for the morning session and 12:30 p.m. for the
            afternoon session. At no time should your child be allowed to exit
            your car without a teacher present. If you arrive late, you must
            escort your child to the classroom. At dismissal (11:45 a.m. and
            3:15 p.m.) children assemble outside the front door on benches or,
            in inclement weather, inside the front door. The teachers bring
            children to their cars. No child can be dismissed to anyone other
            than persons designated (in writing) by the parents. Your child must
            hold hands with a teacher or parent when in front of the school in
            the drop-off/pick-up area.

          <h2>Special Occasions</h2>

          <h3>Birthday Celebrations</h3>
          <p>
            We celebrate each child’s birthday (or half-birthday for children
            with summer dates). If desired, talk with your child’s teacher about
            bringing a special snack to share with the class.
          </p>

          <h3>Holidays</h3>
          <p>
            We are fortunate to have diverse cultures and religious beliefs in
            our nursery school community. Our policy is to celebrate family
            traditions, not the religious aspects, of holidays.
          </p>

          <h3>Field Trips</h3>
          <p>
            Teachers frequently plan short walking trips on campus.
            Occasionally, trips are planned off- campus to further enhance the
            children’s experiences. Each time an off-campus trip is planned,
            parents will be notified in advance and required to sign a form
            granting permission for the child’s participation.

        <div id="spec-needs">
          <h2>Personalized Help and Special Needs</h2>
          <h3>Personalized Help</h3>
          <p>
            The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and
            assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers
            consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
            meet students’ needs. If one or more children need help in a
            specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways,
            which may include:
          </p>
          <div class="bullet">
            <p>
              • Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the
              child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student
              confidence
            </p>
            <p>• Offering more opportunities for exploration</p>
            <p>• Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</p>
            <p>• Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</p>
            <p>
              • Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials
              than previously used in order to engage different parts of the
              brain in the learning process
            </p>
            <p>
              • Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities
              around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Referral Process for Children with Special Needs</h3>
          <p>
            It is the policy at the nursery school that after school is underway
            and teachers have had time to observe children in the classroom, a
            teacher who feels help is needed in understanding the behavior of a
            child in the classroom will ask the director to come and observe.
            After reviewing our observations, we schedule an appointment with
            the parents to discuss the school behavior. In the course of that
            meeting, we may request that a community professional evaluate the
            child in the classroom. This observation may result in a request for
            further evaluation. If needed, community facilities that better
            serve the child’s needs may be recommended to the parents.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <div id="health-safety">
          <h2>Health and Safety</h2>
          <h3>Medication</h3>
          <p>
            The nursery school encourages parents to administer medications at
            home and not at school. The nursery school staff does not routinely
            administer medications to the children. Also, we do not apply
            sunscreen or insect repellent. Medication that absolutely needs to
            be administered during school hours must be cleared with the
            director.
          </p>

          <h3>Allergies</h3>
          <p>
            If your child has a known allergic reaction, this must be documented
            on the child’s History and Health Record kept in his/ her file in
            the office. Also, please report these allergies to the classroom
            teachers. For your child’s safety, these allergies will be posted in
            your child’s classroom. If you object to this information being
            posted, please contact the director. In case of severe allergies
            such as to bee stings or nuts, an EpiPen Injector Kit may be kept at
            the nursery school and used by the director and/or teachers who are
            trained in its administration. This is stored in the emergency
            backpack in the child’s classroom. Each classroom has a First Aid
            Kit that includes the EpiPen (if required). This, along with
            emergency medical forms for every child, accompanies the classes on
            all walking or driving field trips.
          </p>

          <h3>Peanut and Tree Nut Policy</h3>
          <p>
            A growing number of children deal with food allergies and,
            specifically, potentially life- threatening peanut and tree nut
            allergies. Washington University Nursery School will be a peanut-
            and tree nut-free (Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios,
            walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts) preschool beginning with the
            2017-2018 school year. The full explanation of the Peanut and Tree
            Nut Policy describes how teachers and families will support the
            efforts of safeguarding the health and safety of the children.
          </p>

          <h3>Accidents</h3>
          <p>
            The nursery school makes every effort to ensure the safety of all
            children. However, should a serious accident occur, a parent is
            immediately contacted. If parents and emergency contacts cannot be
            reached, we will take your child to the hospital designated on your
            enrollment form. Minor injuries will be reported to you by your
            child’s teacher at pick-up. All injuries will also be reported in
            written form and given to you at pickup time. We will ask you to
            sign an identical form to be placed in your child’s file at school.
          </p>

          <h3>Health Policy</h3>
          <p>
            The nursery school makes a great effort to provide a healthy
            environment for your children. We work diligently on forming healthy
            habits such as washing hands before eating or handling food, and
            after toileting. Our dishes and cups are put through a dishwasher/
            sanitizer to sterilize them and to prevent the spread of germs. The
            rooms are thoroughly cleaned daily and checked for safety. However,
            despite everyone’s best efforts, children and adults will get sick.
            It is an expected part of life. If children become ill at school,
            they will be cared for in the office until a parent can pick them
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents are requested to keep their child home in the event of the
            diseases or symptoms noted below. The child will be allowed to
            return to school when he or she has been free of these symptoms and
            has not required medication for a minimum of 24 hours. If a symptom
            persists (such as rash or cough), or if a communicable disease is
            confirmed (measles, chicken pox, etc.), returning to school may
            require a statement from the child’s physician declaring that the
            condition is no longer contagious.
          </p>
          <p>
            PLEASE CALL the nursery school to inform us that your child is sick,
            especially if he/ she has a communicable disease. Communicable
            diseases or conditions include:
          </p>
          <p>
            Strep throat, Mumps, Hepatitis A, Scabies, Chicken Pox, Impetigo,
            Diarrheal diseases, Pinworm, Measles, Conjunctivitis, Lice,
            Ringworm, certain other viral or bacterial infections
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the following symptoms could indicate a contagious disease:
          </p>
          <p>
            Fever, diarrhea, vomiting, skin eruptions / rashconstant sneezing /
            productive cough, runny nose, lethargy, sore throat, reddened or
            weeping eyes
          </p>
          <p>
            If your child is exposed to or contracts a communicable disease, it
            is essential that you call the nursery school to tell us. In turn,
            we will send a letter home to inform parents that your child has
            been exposed to a communicable disease.
          </p>

        <div id="discipline">
          <h2>Discipline</h2>
          <h3>
            The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and
            nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary
            to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time
            as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our
            rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends
            safe, and the toys at school safe.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic
            situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and
            redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can
            stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not,
            teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are
            emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their
            attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their
            friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with
            others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering
            other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline
            policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and
            reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and
            develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This
            is done through:
          </p>
          <div class="bullet">
            <p>• Positive reinforcement.</p>
            <p>• Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</p>
            <p>
              • Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially
              positive activities.
            </p>
            <p>• Naming and validating child’s feelings</p>
            <p>
              • Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and
              constructive manner.
            </p>
            <p>• Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will
            work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate
            recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding
            and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that
            we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is
            determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool
            experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with
            parents at which it may be decided that this program is not
            appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make
            recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community
            services if parents so desire.

          <h3>Inclement Weather</h3>
          <p>
            The nursery school, as a department within Washington University,
            follows the university policy for school closings as a result of
            inclement weather. It is university policy that faculty and staff
            members should report to work and leave work at their regularly
            scheduled times. Should weather conditions create potentially
            hazardous travel, the vice chancellor for human resources will
            evaluate the severity of the situation and, in consultation with the
            executive vice chancellors, determine the appropriate measures to be
            taken. Factors to be considered will include the safety of our
            faculty, staff and students as well as the services that must be
            provided despite the severe weather. In the event that the decision
            is made to dismiss employees early, the staff of the Office of Human
            Resources will contact the various executive vice chancellors, vice
            chancellors and deans, who, in turn, will be responsible for
            communicating this decision to faculty and staff members. A nursery
            school staff member would then relay that decision to the parent
            community via phone and/or email.
