          Our classes focus on social development and learning through play.
          Each year’s class builds on the previous year’s program in curriculum
          experiences and activities offered. The classrooms are set up to
          invite exploration and foster a lifelong love of learning. Our staff
          is deeply committed to the young child and the importance of early
          childhood education.

        <h2>Ages 2 1/2 – 3: Teddy Bears, Panda Bears</h2>
        <p>
          Children must turn 3 by February 1 of that school year. The focus of
          these classes is on social development and learning through play.
          Separating from parents, learning to take direction, and being
          nurtured by people outside of immediate family are important
          milestones for this age. The building of trust and growing peer
          awareness are enhanced by a safe environment that provides a
          foundation for learning.

        <h2>Ages 3 – 4: Bear Cubs</h2>
        <p>
          The emphasis in this class is to encourage further socialization by
          reinforcing how a child’s choices affect their relationships and
          environment. There are greater expectations for participation and
          appropriate play practices. This class fosters independence,
          creativity, cognitive growth, and motor coordination. Children are
          introduced to phonemic awareness, patterning, number sequencing with
          value recognition and following both verbal and visual directions.

            </li>
            <li>
              Children begin to learn the language and literacy skills that
              promote future academic success through expanded conversations
              with teachers and university student workers. Opportunities are
              provided to explore books and writing materials throughout the
              day.

            <li>
              Classrooms provide developmentally appropriate materials that

        <h2>Ages 4 – 5: Big Bears, Sun Bears</h2>
        <p>
          The intent of this class is to further support the development of
          social awareness, emotional intelligence, and Kindergarten readiness
          skills. Critical thinking, science, sequencing, sorting and
          classification, matching, number values, phonemic awareness, problem
          solving, storytelling and following multi-step directions are all
          incorporated in our curriculum. Children develop their gross and fine
          motor skills while working in large and small groups. Through play and
          collaborative group work, children come to appreciate the value of
          cooperation and contribution. The children are encouraged to take
          risks, helping them discover how the process of learning is often more
          valuable than the outcome. Mastering appropriate academic skills and
          fostering social emotional growth are the cornerstones of this
          program.

            The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom
            activities for children who are enrolled in the half-day program.
            Children who attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day
            classes but perhaps not full-day schedules. Parents may enroll their
            children for participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is
            offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear
            Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are
            designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in
            hands-on learning in a specialized content area, such as art,
            science, movement or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might
            take a nature hike one day, create an art project the next, or
            dramatize a story in any particular week.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the
            progress children are making in their regular classroom within a
            varied and creative curriculum. Children must be toilet- trained to
            enroll in Bear Tracks.
