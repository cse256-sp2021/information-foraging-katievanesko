                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire 
                        to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all developmental areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>         
                        The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are 
                        learning and feeling. We consider the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for children to interact with their environment 
                        in ways that are meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
                        In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, 
                        we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be enriching for our program.
                    </p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3>
                        The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                        cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                        Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                        highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                        months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children
                        are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty,
                        staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the
                        community.
                    </h3>

                            Children come from a variety of countries, cultures and economic
                            backgrounds.&nbsp;The school maintains the high standards of the
                            National Association for the Education of Young Children, by
                            which&nbsp;it&nbsp;is accredited. It is licensed by the State of
                            Missouri.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                            development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                            University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                            assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                            nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’
                            presence enables children to receive additional individual
                            attention.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                            It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                            children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional
                            all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of
                            indoor gross motor play materials.&nbsp;A large outdoor play area
                            gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                            and play in the sand.
