        <h2>
          In addition to their classroom teachers, all children enrolled in the
          Washington University Nursery School interact regularly with
          specialists in art, music, Spanish and science.

        <p>
          Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
          Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
          each month and build understanding through conversations and
          experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
          home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
          of Art.

        <p>
          Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
          songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
          children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
          classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only
          our voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use
          percussion instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize
          the beats we create. All of our repertoire will give us the
          opportunity to explore tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and
          expressiveness, and all will be fun!

          Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes
          for songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will
          list the vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an
          overview of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle
          back to certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.

        <p>
          Nature on the Move allows children to get up close to Missouri’s
          wildlife and learn how each living thing affects the world in which
          they live. I will visit WUNS once per month with a lively
          presentation on a variety of topics.
