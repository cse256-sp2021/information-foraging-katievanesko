        <h2>Enrichment Programs</h2>
        <h3>In addition to their classroom teachers, all children enrolled in the
          Washington University Nursery School interact regularly with
          specialists in art, music, Spanish and science.</h3>

        <h3><a id ="art-suzy" href="files/art_suzy.html">Art with Miss Suzy</a></h3>
        <p>Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art each month and build understanding through conversations and experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element of Art.</p>
          
        <h3><a id ="music-christina" href="files/music_christina.html">Music with Miss Christina</a></h3>
        <p>Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20 songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be fun!</p>
      
        <h3><a id ="spanish-colleen" href="files/spanish_colleen.html">Spanish with Miss Colleen</a></h3>
        <p>Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes for songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will list the vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an overview of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle back to certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.</p>

        <h3><a id ="nature-becky" href="files/nature_becky.html">Nature(Science) on the Move with Miss Becky</a></h3>
        <p>Nature on the Move allows children to get up close to Missouri’s wildlife and learn how each living thing affects the world in which they live. I will visit WUNS once per month with a lively presentation on a variety of topics.</p>

        <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
        <p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and experiences include:</p>
        <div class="bullet">
          <p>• Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</p>
          <p>• Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
            and items</p>
          <p>• Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</p>
          <p>• Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</p>
          <p>• Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</p>
          <p>• Shaping/forming and stringing beads</p>
          <p>• Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of three-
            dimensional items</p>
          <p>• Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
            recyclable materials</p>
          <p>• Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</p>
        </div>
        <p>Students at Washington University Nursery School enjoy exploring visual arts, music and drama with specialists in these areas, in addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground.</p>
