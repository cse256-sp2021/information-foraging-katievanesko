          <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
          <p>
            At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many
            opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We
            value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building
            blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is
            on the process of exploring materials and how they can be
            manipulated, rather than the product of those manipulations. We
            allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
            successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether
            undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a
            child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen
            confidence and emotional well-being while building independence.
            Materials and experiences include:
          </p>
          <div class="bullet">
